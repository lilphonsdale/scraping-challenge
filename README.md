BeautifulSoup and Splinter

#Description

In the first notebook, Splinter's browser is used to visit a website and inspect its contents. BeautifulSoup is used to collect the text from the site and python is used to gather that data in a dictionary.

In the second, Splinter's browser is used to visit a site that contains a table full of data. BeuatifulSoup is used to collect the headers and the data from the table. The data is then entered into a pandas dataframe. 

Pandas functions like unique, mean, groupby, etc. are used to analyze the data and answer a series of questions. Matplotlib is used to visualize the data, which helps us to answer the question of how many days are in a Martian year.
